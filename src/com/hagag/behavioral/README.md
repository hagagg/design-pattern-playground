# 🤝 Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with **how objects interact and communicate** with each other.  
They help define **clear patterns of responsibility**, increase flexibility in communication, and decouple sender and receiver objects.

These patterns focus on how to delegate tasks between objects in a way that leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

> 🔍 Real-world Java implementations of behavioral design patterns are organized here, each in its own subpackage with detailed documentation and examples.
